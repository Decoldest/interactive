# Tortoise Fetch

[Visit Live App](https://fetch-decoldests-projects.vercel.app/ "Visit")

Tortoise Fetch 3D is an interactive 3D web-based game where users can throw a ball, and a tortoise fetches it. The game is built using React Three Fiber and React Three Rapier for the 3D graphics and physics engine, making for a fun and realistic experience. I created this app because I am unable to play fetch with my real life tortoise.

## Features ##
- Realistic Physics: The ball is thrown with a flick-based mechanic, calculating velocity and distance based on your mouse movements.
- 3D Environment: The game takes place in a simple 3D world rendered using React Three Fiber.
- Interactive Ball Throwing: Grab and throw the ball using your mouse or trackpad. The ball responds to the strength and direction of your throw.
- Tortoise Fetching: After you throw the ball, the tortoise will chase after it.

## Technologies Used ##
- React: For the overall app structure and UI components.
- React Three Fiber: To render 3D objects and scenes in the browser using Three.js.
- React Three Rapier: For the physics simulation, including handling the ball's velocity and collisions.

- Throw the ball: Click, drag, and flick the ball to throw it. The harder the flick, the further the ball will go.-
- Watch the tortoise fetch: After the ball is thrown, the tortoise will move towards the ball and bring it back.
- Repeat: Keep throwing the ball and let the tortoise fetch it. That's about it.
